# nucampsite-bootstrap

Course project for NuCamp's Bootstrap course, a campsite review website.

This project was completed over the course of 5 weeks of coursework and weekend workshops.

I worked with Bootstrap's grid system and many pre-build components from Buttons and Navbars to Carousels and Modals. It gave me the opportunity to get more comfortable with npm, and had my first exposure to SASS and SCSS. As the course used an earlier version of Bootstrap, I also worked with jQuery.
